# Silverstripe Image Recipe

Connects the following modules together for delicious Webp and `<picture>` goodness:

- `bigfork/silverstripe-webp-formatter`
- `jonom/focuspoint`
- `kinglozzer/silverstripe-picture`

For usage instructions, see the README for the
[silverstripe-picture module](https://github.com/kinglozzer/silverstripe-picture). All images output will be formatted
as Webp and will include inline `object-position` styles based on the imageâ€™s focus point.
